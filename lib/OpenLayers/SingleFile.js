     * given here must end with a slash. If set to '' (which is the default) 
     * OpenLayers will use its script location + "img/".
     * 
     * You will need to set this property when you have a singlefile build of 
     * OpenLayers that either is not named "OpenLayers.js" or if you move
     * the file in a way such that the image directory cannot be derived from 
     * the script location.
     * 
     * If your custom OpenLayers build is named "my-custom-ol.js" and the images
     * of OpenLayers are in a folder "/resources/external/images/ol" a correct
     * way of including OpenLayers in your HTML would be:
     * 
     * (code)
     *   <script src="/path/to/my-custom-ol.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
     *   <script type="text/javascript">
     *      // tell OpenLayers where the control images are
     *      // remember the trailing slash
     *      OpenLayers.ImgPath = "/resources/external/images/ol/";
     *   </script>
     * (end code)
     * 
     * Please remember that when your OpenLayers script is not named 
     * "OpenLayers.js" you will have to make sure that the default theme is 
     * loaded into the page by including an appropriate <link>-tag, 
     * e.g.:
     * 
     * (code)
     *   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/default/style.css"  type="text/css">
     * (end code)
