## Dotless identifiers

Previously, objects generated by the library were given id properties with values that contained dots (e.g. "OpenLayers.Control.Navigation_2").  These same identifiers are also used for DOM elements in some case.  Though uncommon, a developer may want to access these elements with a CSS selector.  To facilitate this, we now always generate ids with underscore instead of dot.
