# Enhancements and Additions

## Dotless identifiers

Previously, objects generated by the library were given id properties with values that contained dots (e.g. "OpenLayers.Control.Navigation_2").  These same identifiers are also used for DOM elements in some case.  Though uncommon, a developer may want to access these elements with a CSS selector.  To facilitate this, we now always generate ids with underscore instead of dot.

## Better support for analog scroll wheel

Removed rounding of zoom level for maps with fractionalZoom == true. So users with an OS and interface device with analog scroll support will now get smooth zooming.

# Behavior Changes from Past Releases

## window.$ is no longer an alias for OpenLayers.Util.getElement
 
We do no longer create a global variable '$' when such a symbol isn't already
defined. Previous versions of OpenLayers would define '$' to be an alias for 
OpenLayers.Util.getElement. If your application requires window.$ to be defined 
in such a way you can either
 
* include deprecated.js in your custom build or as additional ressource in your
  HTML-file
* or you do the aliasing in your application code yourself:

    window.$ = OpenLayers.Util.getElement;
