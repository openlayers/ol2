------------------
Getting OpenLayers
------------------

OpenLayers lives at http://www.openlayers.org/.

You can get OpenLayers from
    http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/HowToDownload.

---------------------
Installing OpenLayers
---------------------

You can use OpenLayers as-is by copying build/OpenLayers.js and the
entire theme/ and img/ directories up to your webserver, putting them 
in the same directory. The files can be in subdirectories on your website, 
or right in the root of the site, as in these examples. 
To include the OpenLayers library in your web page from the root of the site, use:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="/OpenLayers.js" />

As an example, using bash (with the release files in ~/openlayers ):

    $ cd /var/www/html
    $ cp ~/openlayers/OpenLayers.js ./
    $ cp -R ~/openlayers/theme ./
    $ cp -R ~/openlayers/img ./

If you want to use the multiple-file version of OpenLayers (for, say,
debugging or development purposes), copy the lib/ directory up to your
webserver in the same directory you put the img/ folder. Then add
the following to your web page instead:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/lib/OpenLayers.js" />

As an example, using bash (with the release files in ~/openlayers ):

    $ cd /var/www/html
    $ cp -R ~/openlayers/lib ./
    $ cp -R ~/openlayers/theme ./
    $ cp -R ~/openlayers/img ./


------------------------------------
Using OpenLayers in Your Own Website
------------------------------------

The examples/ directory is full of useful examples.

Documentation is available at http://trac.openlayers.org/wiki/Documentation.
You can generate the API documentation with http://www.naturaldocs.org/:
As an example, using bash (with the release files in ~/openlayers ):

    $ cd ~/openlayers/
    $ /path/to/NaturalDocs -i lib/ -o HTML doc/ -p doc_config/ -s Default OL

Information on changes in the API is available in news.txt.
